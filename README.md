# 2D Object Detection On NuImages
This is the first project done for the 3D Perception, Learning-Based Data Fusion Course held at the University of Parma

## Goal
he goal of this project is to develop an object detection system for autonomous vehicles operating in urban environments using the nuImages dataset. To achieve this, we employed the
Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet-50-FPN backbone, initialized with pretrained weights
from the COCO dataset, and subsequently fine-tuned to recognize the 23 classes specific to
the nuImages dataset.
